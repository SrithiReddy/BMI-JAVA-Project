# BMI-JAVA-Project
# A console application that supports simple BMI (Body Mass Index) analysis functionality through a class called BMIAnalyser.Implemented using Object Oriented Design in java version 8 on NetBeans IDE

This is a simple project part of my course assignment where I mapped my theoritical understanding of Object Oriented Design to real world. 

Design Flow:
1. Identifying Classes was one of the important task.
I have used 4 classes Assignment(Main), BMIAnalyser, View, Record.

2. Undertanding each class functionality and relationship between the classes

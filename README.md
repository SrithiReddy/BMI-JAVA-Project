# BMI-JAVA-Project
# A console application that supports simple BMI (Body Mass Index) analysis functionality through a class called BMIAnalyser.Implemented using Object Oriented Design in java version 8 on NetBeans IDE

This is a simple project part of my course assignment where I mapped my theoritical understanding of Object Oriented Design to real world. 

Design Flow:
1. Identifying Classes was one of the important task. I have used 4 classes Assignment(This is Main class), BMIAnalyser(Core Functionality Class), View(For user to interact), Record(It is the property class consists of weight,height all required properties).
2. Undertanding each class functionality and relationship between the classes.
3. Adding access modifiers whenever required for Abstraction.
4. Finally creating objects and initilizing fields using constructors.
